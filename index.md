## About Me

Welcome! I am a Full Professor of Communication Science at Beijing Jiaotong University in China. I earned my PhD in Communication Science from Renmin University of China in 2009. I have also held visiting scholar positions at the University of Missouri (2007- 2008), the University of Florida (2015–2016), City University of Hong Kong (2018), and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2024).

My research interests encompass communication effects, political communication, and online public opinion. Recently, I have focused on new media effects in the context of international perceptions, and the dynamics between domestic and international public opinion. My methodological expertise lies in utilizing data science approaches to analyze media usage, communication effects, and social media data. 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including international journals such as Asian Journal of Communication, the International Communication Gazette, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, as well as top Chinese journals like Journalism & Communication Research (新闻与传播研究), The International Journalism Review (国际新闻界), Modern Communication (现代传播), Journalism University (新闻大学). Some of my works have also been presented at leading international conferences, such as ICA, IAMCR, and AEJMC. These works have been funded by the National Social Science Fund of China, the State Council Information Office of the PRC, and the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the PRC.
