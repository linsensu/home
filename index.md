## About Me

Welcome! I am a Professor of Communication Science at [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/) in China. I earned my PhD in Communication Science from Renmin University of China in 2009. I have also held visiting scholar positions at the University of Missouri (2007- 2008), the University of Florida (2015–2016), City University of Hong Kong (2018), and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2024).

My research interests encompass communication effects, political communication, and online public opinion. Recently, I have focused on new media effects in the context of international perceptions, and the dynamics between domestic and international public opinion. My methodological expertise lies in utilizing data science approaches to analyze media usage, communication effects, and social media data. 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including international journals such as Asian Journal of Communication, the International Communication Gazette, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, as well as top Chinese journals like Journalism & Communication Research (新闻与传播研究), The International Journalism Review (国际新闻界), Modern Communication (现代传播), Journalism University (新闻大学). Some of my works have also been presented at leading international conferences, such as ICA, IAMCR, and AEJMC. These works have been funded by the National Social Science Fund of China, the State Council Information Office of the PRC, and the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the PRC.

## Research Interests
- **Communication effects:** Competition and cooperation between traditional media and new media, influence of new media use on well-being, and presumed media’s influence
- **Political communication:** Media’s role in political participation and civic engagement 
- **Online public opinion:** opinion dynamics in the process of evolution, including on the interaction between domestic and international public opinion, as well as online and offline opinion 

## Research
Do the news media still have a significant influence on the formation of public opinion? How do emerging media change society as well as individuals’ lives? The emergence of the Internet and social media has generated new queries about the power of new and traditional media and their complex and dynamic interactions. My research addresses these queries and contributes to media effects research both theoretically and methodologically, particularly in following three fields.

**1. Public Opinion Dynamics**

My research has addressed the opinion dynamics in the process of evolution, including on the interaction between communicators and audience, online and offline opinion. My research focus on the agenda-setting effects of opinion, and how media influence on U.S. public opinion regarding China. These studies expanded traditional public opinion theories by addressing individual differences in agenda setting research and dynamic evolution of opinion. Recently I focused on the public opinion dynamics in an international context, especially the interaction between domestic and international public opinion.

**2. Media Use and Effect**

My research examine the changes of media use patterns, especially the competition of new and traditional media use. My recent work systematically examined the differential effects of media use on everyday life including civic engagement and well-being, and emotional outcomes like social isolation, with focus on the effect of algorithm recommendation on social media use. Some of my recent research projects investigated the dissemination and influence of (mis)information in China.

**3. Relationship between Media Consumption and Economic Development**

I systematically introduced and tested Western theories such as the Principle of Relative Constancy in the Chinese context. I highlighted the amplifying effects of media consumption on macroeconomic fluctuations in China, contrasting Western theories, and provided theoretical and practical frameworks for evaluating regional media and cultural industries.
